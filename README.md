# Study of Algorithm

This book is a record of my endeavor to understand algorithm both in depth and breadth in the course of solving LeetCode problems.

The goal of writing this book (also practicing algorithms) is **NOT to memorize** specific solutions.

Studying algorithm is a task of **solving unknowns**. Instead of the solutions, we should focus on how we come up with the solution, thus preparing ourselves when encountering unknown challenges.

Based on this ideology, I do my best to write down my understanding, inspirations from others, and various pratical patterns of each problem, while the solution is the least in concern.

**Chapters** are categorized by the data structures and algorithm involved.
