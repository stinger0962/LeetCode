Divide two integers without using multiplication, division and mod operator.

If it is overflow, return MAX\_INT.

Algorithm:  bitwise operator 



Repeatedly call divisor &lt;&lt; 1 to double its size until we find the largest divisor \* 2^power still smaller than dividend.

Subtract divisor &lt;&lt; n \(n is the value we find\) from dividend, 

Add 1 &lt;&lt; n to our final result\(quotient\)

Repeatedly call the above procedure until dividend locates in the range of valid remainder \[0, divisor\);



```
class Solution {
public:
    int divide(int dividend, int divisor) {
        if (divisor == 0 || (dividend == INT_MIN && divisor == -1) )
            return INT_MAX;
        int sign = ((dividend < 0) ^ (divisor < 0)) ? -1 : 1;
        long dvded = labs(dividend); // because abs(INT_MIN) can't fit into int, have to use long absolute()
        long dvsor = labs(divisor);
        int result = 0;
        // edit dvded while doing bitwise operation until it locates in [0,dvsor), which is a valid remainder
        while (dvded >= dvsor) { 
            long temp = dvsor;
            int multp = 1;
            // find the largest quodient by bitwise operation
            while (dvded >= (temp << 1)) {
                temp = temp << 1;
                multp = multp << 1;
            }
            dvded -= temp;
            result += multp;
        }
        return sign == 1 ? result : -result;
    }
};
```
