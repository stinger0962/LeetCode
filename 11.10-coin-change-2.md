You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money. Write a function to compute the number of combinations that make up that amount. You may assume that you have infinite number of each kind of coin.

**Note:**You can assume that

* 0 
  &lt;
  = amount 
  &lt;
  = 5000
* 1 
  &lt;
  = coin 
  &lt;
  = 5000
* the number of coins is less than 500
* the answer is guaranteed to fit into signed 32-bit integer

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
 amount = 5, coins = [1, 2, 5]

Output:
 4

Explanation:
 there are four ways to make up the amount:
5=5
5=2+2+1
5=2+1+1+1
5=1+1+1+1+1
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:
 amount = 3, coins = [2]

Output:
 0

Explanation:
 the amount of 3 cannot be made up just with coins of 2.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input:
 amount = 10, coins = [10] 

Output:
 1
```

1. Tried backtracking, but encounter problem of time exceed. \(No problem in logic\)
2. Use DP, but the transition is not easy to find. **A few tips**:

   ```
    2.1. Key for DP is to find expression for dp\[i\]\[j\] using any former cells, not limited to i-1 or j-1

    2.2.  Expression for dp\[i\]\[j\] usually consists of two directions, sometimes a third direction.

            \(a\) dp\[less i\]\[j\]     \(b\) dp\[i\]\[less j\]     \(c\) optional dp\[less i\]\[less j\]
   ```

   Be **flexible **when consist the formula for dp\[i\]\[j\]
