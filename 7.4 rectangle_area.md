# Rectangle Area

Find the total area covered by two rectilinear rectangles in a 2D plane.

Each rectangle is defined by its bottom left corner and top right corner as shown in the figure.

Assume that the total area is never beyond the maximum possible value of int.



###The Idea

At first glance, there are quite a bit different situations that two rectangles can overlap with each other.

We want to sort the problem in one single step, regardless how they overlap.

If we can locate the overlapping area, we can get the total area.

Look into the overlapping area, it is consisted of overlapping X times overlapping Y.

Thus we can tackle down this problem by locating the overlapping X and Y, respectively.

###The Code

```
class Solution {
public:
    // We calculate the overlapping range of x and y.
    // Then the total area is area rec1 + area rec2 - overlappingX * overlappingY
    int computeArea(int A, int B, int C, int D, int E, int F, int G, int H) {
        int overlapX = 0;
        int overlapY = 0;
        int areaRec1 = (C-A)*(D-B);
        int areaRec2 = (G-E)*(H-F);
        // Either x or y has no overlapping, which menas the two rectangles do not overlap 
        if(G < A || C < E || H < B || D < F){
            return areaRec1 + areaRec2;
        }
        // Calculate overlapping of x
        overlapX = A > E ? (G > C ? C - A : G - A) : (G > C ? C - E : G - E);
        // Calculate overlapping of y
        // The behaviors of y mirrors that of x 
        overlapY = B > F ? (H > D ? D - B : H - B) : (H > D ? D - F : H - F);
        return areaRec1 + areaRec2 - overlapX * overlapY;
    }
};
```
