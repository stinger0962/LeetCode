# Dungeon Game

The demons had captured the princess **(P)** and imprisoned her in the bottom-right corner of a dungeon. The dungeon consists of M x N rooms laid out in a 2D grid. Our valiant knight **(K)** was initially positioned in the top-left room and must fight his way through the dungeon to rescue the princess.

The knight has an initial health point represented by a positive integer. If at any point his health point drops to 0 or below, he dies immediately.

Some of the rooms are guarded by demons, so the knight loses health (negative integers) upon entering these rooms; other rooms are either empty (0's) or contain magic orbs that increase the knight's health (positive integers).

In order to reach the princess as quickly as possible, the knight decides to move only rightward or downward in each step.


Write a function to determine the knight's minimum initial health so that he is able to rescue the princess.

For example, given the dungeon below, the initial health of the knight must be at least 7 if he follows the optimal path RIGHT-> RIGHT -> DOWN -> DOWN.
		



| -2 (K) | -3 | 3 |
| -- | -- | -- |
| -5 | -10 | 1 |
| 10 | 30 | -5(P) |



Notes:

The knight's health has no upper bound.

Any room can contain threats or power-ups, even the first room the knight enters and the bottom-right room where the princess is imprisoned.

###Thinking Process

  Different to general maze problems, it is not easy to grasp the core (**what we need**) at first glance. Yet, one thing is for sure, we are looking for **a best path consuming least resource** (hp in this problem).
  
  
  As usual, I tried approaching with DP, building a full table from top-left to bottom-right. Each cell represents the min hp required to survive from entrance to the room. It failed because I cannot deal with continuous power-up rooms. 
  
  Instead of starting from top-left, we should start from bot-right, building the table in the opposite direction. By this way, we can handle power-ups smoothly. 
  
  ###Top-down DP
  
  In the DP table hp, ```hp[i][j]``` **represents** the min hp required to survive from ```room[i][j]``` to the princess's room. Each cell in DP is a **partial solution**.
  
Suppose we know hp[i][j+1] is the min hp to survive from ```room[i][j+1]``` to Princess's room. 

Let's have a look at hp[i][j]. We will find that no matter room[i][j] contains monsters or power-ups, ```hp[i][j] = hp[i][j+1] - room[i][j]```.

There is one exception : if the subtraction makes hp[i][j] less than 1. 

Put these together, we have ```hp[i][j] = max(1, hp[i][j+1] - room[i][j])```.

However, the above formula is just one candidate for ```hp[i][j]``` -- when we move right. We can also move down. The real ```hp[i][j] ```is the smaller one of two candidates.

The **final formula** should look like:

```hp[i][j] = min (hp[i][j] when moving right, hp[i][j] when moving down)```
  
  

###Lesson Learned

When the bot-up DP(building from 0 to target) fails, **try the other direction** -- top-down DP. Vice versa. 

###The Code

```
class Solution {
public:
    // This problem is unique in that it starts building the DP table from bottom, right 
    int calculateMinimumHP(vector<vector<int>>& dungeon) {
        int height = dungeon.size();
        if(height == 0) return 1;
        int width = dungeon[0].size();
        // 2D DP array, hp[i][j] represents the min hp required to survive from room[i][j] to princess's room
        // We will build the array from bottom-right to top-left.
        vector<vector<int>> hp(height, vector<int>(width, 0));
        hp[height-1][width-1] = max(1, 1 - dungeon[height-1][width-1]);

        for(int i = height-1; i >= 0 ; i--){
            for(int j = width-1; j >= 0; j--){
                if(i == height-1 && j == width-1){
                    hp[i][j] = max(1, 1 - dungeon[i][j]);
                }
                else if(i == height-1){
                    hp[i][j] = max(1, hp[i][j+1] - dungeon[i][j]);
                }
                else if(j == width-1){
                    hp[i][j] = max(1, hp[i+1][j] - dungeon[i][j]);
                }
                else{
                    int right = max(1, hp[i][j+1] - dungeon[i][j]);
                    int down = max(1, hp[i+1][j] - dungeon[i][j]);
                    hp[i][j] = min(right, down);
                }
            }
        }
        return hp[0][0];
    }
};
```
