# Regular Expression Match

Implement regular expression matching with support for ```'.'``` and ```'*'```.


```
'.' Matches any single character.
'*' Matches zero or more of the preceding element.

The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).

The function prototype should be:
bool isMatch(const char *s, const char *p)

Some examples:
isMatch("aa","a") → false
isMatch("aa","aa") → true
isMatch("aaa","aa") → false
isMatch("aa", "a*") → true
isMatch("aa", ".*") → true
isMatch("ab", ".*") → true
isMatch("aab", "c*a*b") → true```

###Clarification, and a Little Inspiration

Before we start, we need to make certain about what * actually does.

```*``` only has effects on its preceding character. For example, in ```abc*bc```,  * only works on the preceding ```char c```.

c* has two usages. 
1. It removes c from the string.
2. It repeats c at least one time. In this case, we can **think of ```c* ```as ```cc*```**. This is the very **inspiration** we need to solve the problem.



###Hello, Again! Recursion

The fundamental idea is to solve the problem using recusion. 

We want to solve isMatch(str s, str p) using isMatch(str s.substr(1), str p.substr(1)).

We have several cases to set up before we can call the recusion.

1. Ending condition : p is empty.
2. We can't call the recursion when p[1] is ```*```.  Therefor, we need to consider this pattern individually.
3. Since ```*``` has two usages, we actually have two cases to deal with.

###The Code

The code is surprising short, despite some difficulty to understand the long compositive boolean statement. Don't worry, we will explain it in detail. 

In the case of ```p[1] == '*'``` we have to consider two conditions, whether ```*``` means empty or repeat the preceding char. 

1. If ```*``` means empty, recursively call```isMatch(s, p.substr(2))```.

2. If ```*``` means repeating, we compare the first chars first, then call recursion: ```isMatch(s.substr(1), p)```. The thinking of ```c* ``` as ```cc*``` trick is used here. 

The case  ```p[1] != '*'``` is straightforward -- compare the first char,. and recursively call ```isMatch(s.substr(1), p.substr(1))```

```
class Solution {
public:
    bool isMatch(string s, string p) {
        if(p.empty()){
            return s.empty();
        }
        if(p[1] == '*'){
            return isMatch(s, p.substr(2)) || ( !s.empty() && (s[0] == p[0] || p[0] == '.') && isMatch(s.substr(1), p) );
        }
        else{
            return !s.empty() && (s[0] == p[0] || p[0] == '.') && isMatch(s.substr(1), p.substr(1));
        }
    }
};
